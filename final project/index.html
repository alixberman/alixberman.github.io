        <h1>Syracuse University Athletic Funding</h1>
        <h2>Where Is All The Money Going?</h2>
        <p>By Alix Berman</p>

    

      <p>Syracuse University’s students believe that their athletic team’s performance levels would positively incline with increased funding.</p>
      <p>Gabby Lantier, a sophomore on the SU softball team said that she believes that there is a correlation between a teams performance and their funding. Being in the ACC she has noticed a difference in the teams who have more resources, and believes it enhances their skill level, and game quality</p>
      <p>“Being the ACC there are a lot of schools with a lot of funding and their programs are definitely well advanced. There are vast majorities between us a lot of the ACC schools that we play” Lantier said.. “Just in terms of facilities, field crew, and the quality of our field.” 
      </p>
      <p>One school that Lantier specifically mentioned was Clemson University.According to Syracuse University’s W9– in 2022, Clemson’s coaching salary was over $14 million– far surpassing Head Coach Dino Babers who was the highest paid Syracuse University employee in 2022. Baber earned approximately $4 million, and his team lost half of their games.</p>
      <p>In terms of the ACC, softball is football’s “sister sport,” said Lantier. Therefore, funds that are allocated to the men’s football team also have to be attributed to the women's softball team due to Title IX. Lantier said that this connects her team to SU football’s. </p>
      <p>This past football season SU was ranked 11th in the ACC, but every university that surpassed them had a coach with a larger salary. Florida State University is another notable school that Lantier mentioned. Mike Norvel, the FSU head football coach, received a salary of $10 million this past season</p>
      <p>“Florida State is one of the most successful programs in the ACC. Because of that, their programs get a lot more funding and they get a lot more publicity,”  Lantier said.</p>

      <p class="caption">Syracuse University’s expenses vs revenues</p>
      <p>Dr. Karen Weaver, who studies college sports and financing at the  University of Pennsylvania, said schools  with a larger following will earn more money, and allocate those funds to the highest grossing department. Programs such as FSU and Clemson have a massive football following enabling them to receive a surplus of money, said Weaver.</p>
      <p>“We’ve consistently seen that [the funding a program has impacts its team’s performance] no matter what sport it is, it’s whether it's producing revenue for the school,” Weaver said. Because the investment the schools make is something that reflects their value to the institution. And that’s one of the great challenges right now in higher education.”</p>
<p>The ACC as a conference holds 15 schools, who do not receive the same media coverage as those in the Southern eastern conference and the Big 10 conference. Weaver said that by
  institution there is approximately a $30 million a year gap when comparing SU to a school in one of those conferences. 
  </p>
  <p>Recruitment and funding also play a large role in university athletic funding. A study conducted by the NCAA found that schools investing more in athletic scholarships tend to attract higher-caliber athletes, leading to enhanced performance on the field. Syracuse's allocation of athletic scholarships pales in comparison to peers, affecting its ability to recruit top talent. 
  </p>

<p>“The quality in Syracuse athletics is huge but the individual programs could definitely use more funding in compared to other schools in the ACC,” said Lantier </p>
